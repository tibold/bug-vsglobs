# bug-vsglobs
A repository demonstrating a Visual Studio bug using ProjectReferences with glob patterns

## dotnet 

Everything works as expected on the command line and older versions of Visual Studio

## Visual Studio

Both building and running in Visual Studio fails with build errors. 

The Project references are also not displayed under Dependencies.
